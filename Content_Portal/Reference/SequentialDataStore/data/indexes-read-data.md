### Indexes and reading data

Most read operations take at least one index as a parameter. Indexes may be specified as strings, or 
using the SDS Client libraries, the index may be passed as-is to read methods that take the index 
type as a generic argument. For more information, see [Indexes](xref:sdsIndexes). For information on compound indexes, see [Compound indexes](xref:sdsIndexes#compound-indexes).
